# VoLTE Call Flow Description

This section outlines the VoLTE (Voice over LTE) call flow process, focusing on key stages and network elements involved. VoLTE enables high-definition voice calls over LTE networks, leveraging the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) architecture for call setup, maintenance, and teardown.

The call flow includes:
1. **IMS Registration**: Initial registration of the user with the IMS core network.
2. **Call Setup**: Establishing a call session using SIP signaling.
3. **Bearer Establishment**: Configuring QoS bearers for the voice call.
4. **Call Maintenance**: Managing the ongoing call session.
5. **Call Teardown**: Properly terminating the call session and releasing resources.
