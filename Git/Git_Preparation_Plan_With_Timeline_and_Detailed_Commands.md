- **Goals:**
  - Implement branching strategies.
  - Merge branches and resolve conflicts effectively.

**Week 4: Remote Repositories**
- Learn how to work with remote repositories:
  - Add a remote repository: `git remote add origin <repository_url>`

  - Push changes to the remote repository: `git push`
- Understand how to clone repositories and work with collaborators:
  - Clone a repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
- **Goals:**
  - Manage remote repositories.
  - Collaborate with others using Git.

## 3. Advanced Git Concepts

**Week 5: Rebasing and Interactive Rebasing**
- Understand rebasing and how it differs from merging:
  - Rebase a branch: `git rebase <branch_name>`
- Learn about interactive rebasing:
  - Start an interactive rebase: `git rebase -i <commit_hash>`
- **Goals:**
  - Use rebasing to maintain a clean project history.
  - Implement interactive rebasing for complex history rewriting.

**Week 6: Stashing and Tagging**
- Learn how to stash changes:
  - Stash changes: `git stash`
  - Apply stashed changes: `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`
  - List stashed changes: `git stash list`
- Understand tagging and how to create and manage tags:
  - Create a tag: `git tag <tag_name>`
  - Annotated tag: `git tag -a <tag_name> -m "tag message"`
  - Push tags to remote repository: `git push origin <tag_name>` or `git push --tags`
- **Goals:**
  - Use stashing to manage work in progress.
  - Tag important commits for releases.

**Week 7: Undoing Changes**
- Learn how to undo changes:
  - Checkout a file: `git checkout -- <file_name>`
  - Revert a commit: `git revert <commit_hash>`
  - Reset to a previous commit: `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` or `git reset --soft <commit_hash>`
- **Goals:**
  - Use Git commands to undo changes.
  - Understand when to use `git revert` versus `git reset`.

## 4. Git Workflows and Best Practices

**Week 8: Git Flow and Feature Branch Workflow**
- Learn about Git Flow and its commands:
  - Initialize Git Flow: `git flow init`
  - Start a new feature: `git flow feature start <feature_name>`
  - Finish a feature: `git flow feature finish <feature_name>`
- Understand the Feature Branch workflow:
  - Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b <feature_branch_name>`
- **Goals:**
  - Implement Git Flow in projects.
  - Use the Feature Branch workflow for better collaboration.

**Week 9: Forking Workflow**
- Learn how to fork repositories on GitHub/GitLab:
  - Fork a repository using the web interface.
  - Clone the forked repository: `git clone <forked_repository_url>`
- Understand how to contribute to open-source projects using forks:
  - Add the original repository as a remote: `git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>`
  - Fetch changes from the original repository: `git fetch upstream`
  - Merge changes from the original repository: `git merge upstream/main`
- **Goals:**
  - Use the Forking workflow for collaboration.
  - Contribute to open-source projects effectively.

**Week 10: Code Review and Pull Requests**
- Understand the importance of code reviews.
- Learn how to create and review pull requests on GitHub/GitLab:
  - Create a pull request using the web interface.
  - Review pull requests and leave comments.
- **Goals:**
  - Participate in code reviews.
  - Create and manage pull requests.

## 5. Git for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**Week 11: Setting up CI/CD with Git**
- Learn about CI/CD concepts and benefits.
- Understand how to integrate Git with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions:
  - Create a `.github/workflows` directory and add a workflow YAML file for GitHub Actions.
  - Configure a Jenkins pipeline with a `Jenkinsfile`.
- **Goals:**
  - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline.
  - Integrate Git with CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment.

## 6. Practical Projects and Continuous Learning
